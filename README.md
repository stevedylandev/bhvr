A full-stack TypeScript monorepo starter with shared types, using Bun, Hono, Vite, and React

## Why bhvr?

While there are plenty of existing app building stacks out there, many of them are either bloated, outdated, or have too much of a vendor lock-in. bhvr is built with the opinion that you should be able to deploy your client or server in any enviorment while also keeping type saftey.

## Features

- **Full-Stack TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety between client and server
- **Shared Types**: Common type definitions shared between client and server
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized as a workspaces-based monorepo
- **Modern Stack**:
  - [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the JavaScript runtime
  - [Hono](https://hono.dev) as the backend framework
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for frontend bundling
  - [React](https://react.dev) for the frontend UI

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ client/               # React frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ server/               # Hono backend
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/               # Shared TypeScript definitions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/types/        # Type definitions used by both client and server
â””â”€â”€ package.json          # Root package.json with workspaces
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies for all workspaces
bun install
```
### Create Project

```bash
bun create bhvr@latest
```

### Development

```bash
# Run shared types in watch mode, server, and client all at once
bun run dev

# Or run individual parts
bun run dev:shared  # Watch and compile shared types
bun run dev:server  # Run the Hono backend
bun run dev:client  # Run the Vite dev server for React
```

### Building

```bash
# Build everything
bun run build

# Or build individual parts
bun run build:shared  # Build the shared types package
bun run build:client  # Build the React frontend
```

### Deployment

Deplying each piece is very versatile and can be done numerous ways, and exploration into automating these will happen at a later date. Here are some references in the meantime.

**Server**

- [Node.js](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/nodejs)

## Type Sharing

Types are automatically shared between the client and server thanks to the shared package and TypeScript path aliases. You can import them in your code using:

```typescript
import { ApiResponse } from '@shared/types';
```
